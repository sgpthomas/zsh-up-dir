# ZSH Up dir

This is a very simple plugin that binds `Ctrl+h` to navigating up a directory. This makes it very easy
to go up a few directories without having to type any commands.

I haven't tested this on a wide varieties of prompts and so the prompt refreshing in place may not work
for every setup. If it doesn't work for you, open an issue and I can try to fix it. I'm also open to PRs
that fix particular setups.

I didn't come up with the perl program this code uses. I found it online somewhere a long time ago.
Thank you internet.
